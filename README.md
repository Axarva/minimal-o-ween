A lil spooky dwm configs
<h1> Here are my dwm configs.</h1>
<h2>Installation</h2>
Copy the files to their respective places, edit the `config.h` file to suit your needs.
<b>EDIT ALL `.sh` FILES TO SUIT YOUR PATHS ELSE STUFF WILL NOT WORK.</b>
For Firefox theme, get the <a href="https://github.com/MiguelRAvila/SimplerentFox">SimplerentFox theme</a>.
For rofi configs, get <a href="https://gitlab.com/vahnrr/rofi-menus#requirements">rofi menu</a>.
The bar script is from <a href="https://github.com/joestandring/dwm-bar ">dwm-bar<br></a>
Note: Any mentions of foo.sh or unfoo.sh refer to the idle inhibiting function (which is just a neat trick which presses the Left Shift key every 30 seconds to prevent screen locking when watching a video, attending a meeting and such.) Please change the occurences of the names foo.sh and unfoo.sh to inhibitor.sh and deactivate_inhibitor.sh in the dwm config file. The scripts are in the myscripts directory above.</h4>

The fonts I recommend are:
<ul>
<li>Museo Sans</li>
<li>Fira Code</li>
<li>Fontawesome</li>
<li>JoyPixels</li>
<li>Hurmit Medium Nerd Font (optional; for rofi)</li>
</ul>
